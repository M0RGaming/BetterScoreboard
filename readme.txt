This is a small addon that aims to provide a few simple features to the battlegrounds scoreboard.
- Shows user and charecter name on a BG scoreboard
- Shows player damage and player healing in the BG scoreboard without having to select the player.
- Shows every player's class icons in the scoreboard next to their name.
- Shows the bg type in the medals portion of the screen.

In addition, the addon will allow you to queue for multiple bg queues at once, similar to how the gamepad ui does it
